abstract = {Abstract Directly standardized mortality rates are examples of weighted sums of Poisson rate parameters. If the numbers of events are large then normal approximations can be used to calculate confidence intervals, but these are inadequate if the numbers are small. We present a method for obtaining approximate confidence limits for the weighted sum of Poisson parameters as linear functions of the confidence limits for a single Poisson parameter, the unweighted sum. The location and length of the proposed interval depend on the method used to obtain confidence limits for the single parameter. Therefore several methods for obtaining confidence intervals for a single Poisson parameter are compared. For single parameters and for weighted sums of parameters, simulation suggests that the coverage of the proposed intervals is close to the nominal confidence levels. The method is illustrated using data on rates of myocardial infarction obtained as part of the WHO MONICA Project in Augsburg, Federal Republic of Germany.},

ABSTRACT = {Background: The category of the “stromal tumors of the lower female genital tract” encompasses a wide spectrum of lesions with variable heterogeneity, which can be nosologically classified on the basis of their morphologic and immunohistochemical profiles as deep (aggressive) angiomyxoma (DAM), cellular angiofibroma (CAF), angiomyofibroblastoma (AMFB) or myofibroblastoma (MFB). Despite the differential diagnosis between these entities being usually straightforward, their increasingly recognized unusual morphological variants, along with the overlapping morphological and immunohistochemical features among these tumours, may raise serious differential diagnostic problems. Methods and Results: The data presented in the present paper have been retrieved from the entire published literature on the PubMed website about DAM, CAF, AFMB and MFB from 1984 to 2021. The selected articles are mainly represented by small-series, and, more rarely, single-case reports with unusual clinicopathologic features. The present review focuses on the diagnostic clues of the stromal tumours of the lower female genital tract to achieve a correct classification. The main clinicopathologic features of each single entity, emphasizing their differential diagnostic clues, are discussed and summarized in tables. Representative illustrations, including the unusual morphological variants, of each single tumour are also provided. Conclusion: Awareness by pathologists of the wide morphological and immunohistochemical spectrum exhibited by these tumours is crucial to achieve correct diagnoses and to avoid confusion with reactive conditions or other benign or malignant entities.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The American Cancer Society (ACS), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Cancer Institute (NCI), and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR) collaborate to provide annual updates on cancer occurrence and trends in the United States. METHODS Incidence data were obtained from the CDC-funded and NCI-funded population-based cancer registry programs and compiled by NAACCR. Data on cancer deaths were obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics National Vital Statistics System. Trends in age-standardized incidence and death rates for all cancers combined and for the leading cancer types by sex, race, and ethnicity were estimated by joinpoint analysis and expressed as the annual percent change. Stage distribution and 5-year survival by stage at diagnosis were calculated for breast cancer, colon and rectum (colorectal) cancer, lung and bronchus cancer, and melanoma of the skin. RESULTS Overall cancer incidence rates from 2008 to 2014 decreased by 2.2\% per year among men but were stable among women. Overall cancer death rates from 1999 to 2015 decreased by 1.8\% per year among men and by 1.4\% per year among women. Among men, incidence rates during the most recent 5-year period (2010-2014) decreased for 7 of the 17 most common cancer types, and death rates (2011-2015) decreased for 11 of the 18 most common types. Among women, incidence rates declined for 7 of the 18 most common cancers, and death rates declined for 14 of the 20 most common cancers. Death rates decreased for cancer sites, including lung and bronchus (men and women), colorectal (men and women), female breast, and prostate. Death rates increased for cancers of the liver (men and women); pancreas (men and women); brain and other nervous system (men and women); oral cavity and pharynx (men only); soft tissue, including heart (men only); nonmelanoma skin (men only); and uterus. Incidence and death rates were higher among men than among women for all racial and ethnic groups. For all cancer sites combined, black men and white women had the highest incidence rates compared with other racial groups, and black men and black women had the highest death rates compared with other racial groups. Non-Hispanic men and women had higher incidence and mortality rates than those of Hispanic ethnicity. Five-year survival for cases diagnosed from 2007 through 2013 ranged from 100\% (stage I) to 26.5\% (stage IV) for female breast cancer, from 88.1\% (stage I) to 12.6\% (stage IV) for colorectal cancer, from 55.1\% (stage I) to 4.2\% (stage IV) for lung and bronchus cancer, and from 99.5\% (stage I) to 16\% (stage IV) for melanoma of the skin. Among children, overall cancer incidence rates increased by 0.8\% per year from 2010 to 2014, and overall cancer death rates decreased by 1.5\% per year from 2011 to 2015. CONCLUSIONS For all cancer sites combined, cancer incidence rates decreased among men but were stable among women. Overall, there continue to be significant declines in cancer death rates among both men and women. Differences in rates and trends by race and ethnic group remain. Progress in reducing cancer mortality has not occurred for all sites. Examining stage distribution and 5-year survival by stage highlights the potential benefits associated with early detection and treatment. Cancer 2018;124:2785-2800. © 2018 American Cancer Society},

	abstract = {Introduction Gynecologic cancers account for an important number of deaths in women in Chile. Substantial efforts have been made over the last 20 years to improve access to health care to reduce cancer mortality.Objective To evaluate gynecologic cancer mortality trends during the last 21 years in Chile.Methods Cause-of-death figures were obtained from 1996 until 2017. Age-adjusted mortality rate was calculated for each gynecologic cancer, using the 2017 census data as the standard population. Logistic regression model was utilized to determine trends, confidence interval and reveal changes in tendencies if occurred.Results Three of the four studied cancers showed a significantly reduction in mortality rates. There was a sustained reduction, although modest, in breast and ovarian cancer mortality of 0.77\% (CI -1.0 to -0.6) and 0,63\% (CI -1.1 to -0.2) per year, respectively. The most significant change was observed in cervical cancer with an annual reduction of 4\% (CI -4.3 to -3.7). All corpus uteri cancers considered together, had a non-significant tendency towards reduction. In a subanalysis of mortality for cervical cancer in women under 40 years, we observed a break in the negative tendency after 2011, revealing a rise of 5.1\% (CI -0.6 to 11.2) per year.Conclusion There was a reduction in mortality rate in most of the studied cancers. Although cervical cancer showed the most important reduction trend, is still far from the lowest figures published in the literature. The change in tendency for the younger population with cervical cancer is of concern.},

abstract = {Substance use disorders (SUDs) are highly prevalent and exact a large toll on individuals’ health, well-being, and social functioning. Long-lasting changes in brain networks involved in reward, executive function, stress reactivity, mood, and self-awareness underlie the intense drive to consume substances and the inability to control this urge in a person who suffers from addiction (moderate or severe SUD). Biological (including genetics and developmental life stages) and social (including adverse childhood experiences) determinants of health are recognized factors that contribute to vulnerability for or resilience against developing a SUD. Consequently, prevention strategies that target social risk factors can improve outcomes and, when deployed in childhood and adolescence, can decrease the risk for these disorders. SUDs are treatable, and evidence of clinically significant benefit exists for medications (in opioid, nicotine and alcohol use disorders), behavioral therapies (in all SUDs), and neuromodulation (in nicotine use disorder). Treatment of SUDs should be considered within the context of a Chronic Care Model, with the intensity of intervention adjusted to the severity of the disorder and with the concomitant treatment of comorbid psychiatric and physical conditions. Involvement of health care providers in detection and management of SUDs, including referral of severe cases to specialized care, offers sustainable models of care that can be further expanded with the use of telehealth. Despite advances in our understanding and management of SUDs, individuals with these conditions continue to be stigmatized and, in some countries, incarcerated, highlighting the need to dismantle policies that perpetuate their criminalization and instead develop policies to ensure support and access to prevention and treatment.},
